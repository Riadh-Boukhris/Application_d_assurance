# Application_d_assurance

In this code, I intended to explore the  Object-Oriented Programming OOP, I created this mini application to learn the basic of the OOP and to practice on coding in C++. This code is not perfect, yet, it is an honest work to make bigger achievement in the future.

For this program, you only nead a cpp compiler and runner. When compiling, you may notice some warnings. To be honest, I'm still figuring what it means, but the program works fine and it won't affect the program.

NB : The formula calculation is not precise. Matter of fact, you may find the output very weird, but, I want to recall that the main purpose of this program is to learn C++ and OOP basics.
Thank you!
